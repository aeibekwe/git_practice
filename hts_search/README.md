This directory is for all things coding and related to work...
I have installed django and requests, but still need to install PostgreSQL and pyscopg2(-binary?).  I will save those installations for when I get further into the project.  For now the most critical installation was requests, so i can interface with the HTS with the http protocol.

to start the interactive shell:
(1) cd to ./Programming
(2) enter 'pipenv shell'
(3) enter 'python3'
(4) import the following modules:
	- requests
	- from main import URL, HTS_Search
