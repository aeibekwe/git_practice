BE CAREFUL! THIS FUNCTION IS RECURSIVE!

This function takes a directory and recurses through it in search of all files, which it then prints.  

Be sure that your input is the Absolute Path of the directory you want to search without the final '/'...

Also, be sure that you're in the get_file_names directory so that results will print to the latest_output.txt file.
