This is just a repository for me to practice programming.  There are a bunch of different random projects included here, and mostly in Python, but I plan on branching out to learn other languages, like Swift.  Also, I'm really interested in machine learning.


Like I said, I'm LEARNING	; so, any pointers, tips, or even ideas for new projects that I can get from you programming pros will be greatly appreciated.
