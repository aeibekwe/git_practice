This is just a repository for me to practice programming.  There are a bunch of different random projects included here, and mostly in Python, but I plan on branching out to learn other languages, like Swift.  Also, I'm really interested in machine learning.


Like I said, I'm LEARNING	; so, any pointers, tips, or even ideas for new projects that I can get from you programming pros will be greatly appreciated.


The project I'm most proud of right now is the hts_search because I successfully incorporated the requests module into it, and that was my first time doing so.  That program will let you search the Harmonized Tariff Schedule for specific things and it then prints the results.  

It can still be modified to handle the data better, but I will cross that bridge when I get there.  For now, I just wanted to use requests, and interface with the RESTful API of the USITC.  Anyways, if you check it out, let me know what you think!
