      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a third-year law student at USC Gould.  Last summer, I worked with Flyer Defense, and I hope to work with them after I graduate as well.</p>
      <p>Before coming to law school, I taught English in Japan and Colombia, I bartended in Los Angeles, and I worked construction in Mexico.</p>
      <p>It is my hope that with this law degree, and my coding studies, I will be able to significantly, and positively, impact the world around me.</p>
