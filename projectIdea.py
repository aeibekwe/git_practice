# Goal. Go to Blackboard, and download all the necessary files for class on a weekly basis... maybe on fridays?

# Steps:
### MIGHT JUST HAVE TO DO THIS BEGINNING STUFF BY HAND FIRST
#1. open Blackboard (https://blackboard.usc.edu/webapps/login/)
#2. login.  Maybe skip straight to (https://login.usc.edu/login/login?spEntityID=https://shibboleth.usc.edu/idp/sp&service=&goto=https://login.usc.edu/sso/SSORedirect/metaAlias/USCRealm/idp?ReqID%3D_cd10a0c9f6b7fce24b61ba9f06d02e91%26index%3Dnull%26acsURL%3Dhttps://shibboleth.usc.edu/idp/sp/Shibboleth.sso/SAML2/POST%26spEntityID%3Dhttps://shibboleth.usc.edu/idp/sp%26binding%3Durn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST)
#3. wait for or get input from user...
### MAYBE START EXECUTING THE PROGRAM HERE... THIS IS THE BULK OF THE WORK
#4. once logged in, there are 5 classes(that's how many I'm in) that need to be checked:
#       1. Taxation (e.g. repeat this with other classes more or less)
#           first page (announcements):
#           https://blackboard.usc.edu/webapps/blackboard/execute/announcement?method=search&context=course_entry&course_id=_259927_1&handle=announcements_entry&mode=view
#           second page (content):
#           https://blackboard.usc.edu/webapps/blackboard/content/listContent.jsp?course_id=_259927_1&content_id=_6869906_1&mode=reset
#           download most recent content (maybe save the url each time a successful download happens, then compare that url to make sure that I'm getting one that I didn't get before...:
#           https://blackboard.usc.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-6987557-dt-content-rid-32038630_2/xid-32038630_2
#           save that content to the designated directory:
#           /Users/aeibekwe/Fall/Taxation/Handouts/
#           repeat something like the above steps for my other classes...
#       2. Computer Science for Lawyers
#       3. First Amendment
#       4. Contract Drafting and Negotiation
#       5. Criminal Procedure
